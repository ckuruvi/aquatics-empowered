Give option to set up recurring reservation.

populate the calendar with available dates

availability is the most important function. distance is like 3rd.
  - filter by "i am available tuesdays, thursdays, and sundays." - these are the facilities that have
  availability on those dates. then order by distance, which matters much less than getting all your sessions in.

- Facilities should add a description of steps when a user arrives. Do they talk to the front desk? call the contact? etc.

- needs to be on search page (in order of importance):
      - level
      - date range
      - cost
      - distance

 - in admin view, make 'approved' or 'pending' different colors and/or add an icon. sorting too.
